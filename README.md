# Adoptable Pets Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores a public dataset of adoptable pets to identify patterns that may help animal shelters and pet adoption organizations improve adoption outcomes. Using Python and data visualization, the analysis examines trends related to animal type, size, and age to better understand the shelter population.

**Dataset Source:**  
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/adoptable-pets


## Questions Explored
The analysis focuses on the following questions:

1. What types of animals appear most frequently in the shelter?
2. How does pet size vary by animal type?
3. What is the overall age distribution of animals in the shelter?
4. Does age vary by animal type?


## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Potential Client
This analysis would be valuable to animal shelters or national pet adoption organizations. The insights can help identify which animals may require additional support, guide adoption outreach efforts, and assist with planning space and resources. Ultimately, these findings can help increase adoption rates and reduce shelter overcrowding.
